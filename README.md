# Simplified-Traditional Chinese converter
A very simple python script to convert text files from simplified Chinese to traditional Chinese.
I made this primarily to convert .srt files, but should work with text files in general. 
Based on [this tutorial](https://yarnthen.github.io/yarnthencohosking/how%20to/2019/03/31/python-convert-traditional-simplified.html),
with some additional features and code changes.

## Usage
`python converter.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile> -l <Optional: s for simplified input (default), t for traditional input>`

If the output file already exists, the script will overwrite it.
